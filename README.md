- Semi-supervised learning techniques can effectively leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve
model performance.
- The choice of semi-supervised technique should consider factors such as dataset characteristics, class
imbalance, and computational resources.
- Balancing the dataset, especially in the presence of class imbalance, can lead to improved performance
of semi-supervised learning techniques.
- Experimentation and fine-tuning are necessary to identify the optimal semi-supervised approach for
specific use cases.
